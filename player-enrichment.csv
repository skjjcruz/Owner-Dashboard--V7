1,Fernando Mendoza,Indiana,4837248,,"Fernando Mendoza (6’5/225) transferred to Indiana and delivered one of the most dominant quarterback seasons in recent college football history in 2025. He completed 70%+ of his passes for 3,535 yards and a nation-leading 41 passing touchdowns, added 6 rushing scores, and guided the Hoosiers to a perfect 16-0 record capped by a 27-21 CFP national championship win over Miami. Earned the Heisman Trophy (first in program history), Maxwell Award finalist recognition, and All-Big Ten First Team honors. Consensus QB1 on 2026 mock draft boards, Mendoza displays excellent accuracy, pocket poise, pre-snap processing, and leadership traits that position him as a high-floor franchise quarterback prospect with Day 1 starter readiness. Weaknesses include average arm strength that limits deep-ball velocity against tight coverage, and occasional sack-prone tendencies when facing pressure (though improved from prior seasons). Projects as the top overall selection in the 2026 NFL Draft with the tools to start immediately and develop into a long-term NFL starter.",Junior,6'5,225,4.85,1.6
2,Arvell Reese,Ohio State,4950400,,"Arvell Reese is a physically imposing 6'4"", 243-pound defender whose versatility as a ""moveable chess piece"" has made him a premier 2026 NFL Draft prospect. The 2025 Big Ten Linebacker of the Year and consensus All-American finished his junior season with 69 tackles and 6.5 sacks, showcasing an elite ""speed-to-power"" profile. Scouts laud his explosive first step and violent hand usage, though his pass-rush plan remains a work in progress. Widely regarded as a blue-chip talent with Micah Parsons-like potential, Reese is currently projected as a top-five lock and a favorite to go No. 2 overall to the New York Jets, cementing his status as the draft's top-ranked defensive player.",Junior,6'4,243,4.52,0.4
3,Rueben Bain,Miami (FL),4870617,,"Rueben Bain Jr. (6’3/275) was one of the most productive and disruptive edge rushers in college football in 2025 at Miami, recording double-digit sacks, 20+ TFLs, and consistent pressures while earning ACC Defensive Player of the Year, Nagurski Trophy finalist status, and unanimous All-American honors. He combined a powerful, explosive frame with a quick first step, violent hand usage, elite run-defense strength, and a high motor that allowed him to impact both pass and run phases. Versatile alignment options (stand-up EDGE to 5-technique) and game-wrecking ability made him a consistent matchup problem for offensive tackles. Consensus top-5 EDGE prospect on most big boards entering the 2026 NFL Draft process. Weaknesses include limited prototypical arm length and elite ankle flexibility/bend to consistently win around the corner with speed; occasional gap discipline lapses when pursuing stats aggressively. Projects as a high-floor, Day 1 starter with top-10 overall pick potential in schemes that value power and motor over pure bend.",Junior,6'3,275,4.72,0.5
4,Carnell Tate,Ohio State,4871023,,"Carnell Tate (6’3/195) didn’t just meet expectations in 2025—he became the latest crown jewel in Ohio State’s legendary WR factory, emerging as a polished, five-star separator with elite route-running savvy, vice-like hands, and jaw-dropping body control that made him a nightmare matchup on every level. He racked up 800+ yards and 8+ touchdowns, flashing explosive deep-threat ability, red-zone dominance, and consistent big-play production that earned him All-Big Ten honors and a spot on the Biletnikoff Award watch list. A true WR1 prospect with first-round polish, smooth releases, and the contested-catch reliability scouts drool over, positioning him as a top-15 overall wideout in the loaded 2026 class. Weaknesses: Lacks elite top-end speed and burst to consistently create separation vertically; YAC elusiveness is solid but not game-breaking; can get jammed and disrupted at the line by long, physical press corners. Still, the tape screams high-floor, high-ceiling starter with WR1 traits ready to translate Day 1.",Junior,6'3,195,4.6,1.4
5,David Bailey,Texas Tech,4685248,,"David Bailey (6’3/250) exploded in 2025 at Texas Tech (post-Stanford transfer), leading FBS with 13.5 sacks, 17.5 TFLs, a 93 PFF pass-rush grade (highest among EDGEs), Unanimous All-American honors, Big 12 Defensive Lineman of the Year, and a #3 ranking on Bruce Feldman’s Freaks List. Elite first-step burst, closing speed, violent hands, and relentless production make him a top-10 overall prospect (potential No. 2-3 non-QB). Explosive pass-rush specialist with three-down flashes and game-wrecking upside. Weaknesses: Poor run defense anchor (timid vs. blockers, high pad level, engulfed often); emotional control issues (past incidents) may drop stock slightly. High-upside disruptor with Day 1 impact potential in 2026.",Senior,6'3,250,4.52,0.5
6,Caleb Downs,Ohio State,4870706,,"Caleb Downs (6’0/205) didn’t just play safety in 2025—he redefined the position after transferring to Ohio State, turning into a generational, scheme-proof chess piece who wrecked offenses from every angle. Elite range that covers half the field, football IQ that reads plays before they happen, bone-crushing open-field tackling, and ball-hawking instincts that produced multiple INTs/PBUs—earning Thorpe Award finalist status, unanimous All-American honors, All-Big Ten First Team, and consensus top-5 overall buzz as the undisputed DB1 of the class. A true unicorn with immediate Day 1 starter upside in single-high, two-high, box, or nickel roles, capable of flipping games with one play. Weaknesses: Over-aggressive tendencies (sells out for hits, occasional missed tackles in space); size/durability concerns against bigger tight ends and blockers in the run game; not elite top-end recovery speed vs. true burners. Still, the traits scream franchise safety—first defensive back off the board in 2026 with All-Pro ceiling written all over him.",Junior,6'0,205,4.45,0.35
7,Jeremiyah Love,Notre Dame,4870808,,"Jeremiyah Love (6’0/214) straight-up detonated in 2025 as Notre Dame’s three-down supernova, morphing into the most complete, explosive, and terrifying running back prospect in the entire class. Legit 4.4 speed that turns on a dime, vision that sees lanes before they exist, velvet-soft hands (50+ catches as a receiver), and home-run burst that left secondaries in the dust—racking up 1,200+ all-purpose yards and 12+ TDs while punishing anyone who dared tackle him. A Doak Walker semifinalist with All-Independent honors, this dude is the ultimate zone-scheme cheat code: patient behind the line, decisive when the hole opens, and absolutely electric in space. He lines up in the slot, smokes linebackers on screens, catches swing passes like a WR, and turns short gains into house calls with YAC violence. Versatile modern weapon who can be your RB1, change-of-pace back, or third-down mismatch nightmare—early 2026 first-round whispers are turning into screams. Weaknesses? Pass-pro technique is still maturing (occasional whiffs against speed rushers); ball security lapses under heavy contact (a few fumbles when he’s taking big hits). But those are coachable, fixable, low-floor issues on a sky-high ceiling. The traits scream RB1 from Day 1: elite burst, vision, hands, contact balance, special-teams upside, and the kind of juice that makes defensive coordinators lose sleep. In a loaded 2026 RB class, Love is the one teams will fight over at the top of Round 1. Franchise back. Game-changer. The clear #1 RB off the board.",Junior,6'0,214,4.4,1.4
8,Jordyn Tyson,Arizona State,4880281,,"Jordyn Tyson (6’2/200) transferred from Colorado to Arizona State in 2025 and quickly established himself as one of the most productive and reliable boundary receivers in the Big 12. He finished the season with over 1,000 receiving yards and 10+ touchdowns, demonstrating strong contested-catch ability (top-10 rate in the class), effective yards after catch, and physicality at the catch point that allowed him to win consistently on the perimeter. He earned All-Big 12 honors and was named a Biletnikoff Award semifinalist, showing dependable hands, route nuance, and red-zone effectiveness on back-shoulder and fade throws. A polished separator with good size and reliable production, he projects as a low-risk prospect with WR2/WR1 potential in pro schemes. Areas for development include elite top-end speed to stretch the field vertically and handling physical press coverage from longer corners at the line of scrimmage. Overall, his combination of traits, production, and consistency gives him a solid Day 2 projection (Round 2-3 range) in the 2026 NFL Draft with immediate starter upside at the next level.",Junior,6'2,200,4.5,1.4
9,Mansoor Delane,LSU,4880124,,"Mansoor Delane (6’0/190) didn’t just lock down LSU’s secondary in 2025—he turned it into a no-fly zone after transferring from Virginia Tech, leading the entire SEC with 13 pass breakups, allowing a microscopic 26.7 passer rating when targeted, racking up 45 tackles, and snagging multiple INTs/PBUs that flipped games. A unanimous All-American, First-Team All-SEC selection, Jim Thorpe Award semifinalist, and consensus top-15 overall prospect (CB3-5 range), Delane is an elite press-man technician with lightning-quick feet, razor-sharp route awareness, ball-hawking instincts, and nasty physicality in run support that makes him a complete boundary nightmare. Declared early for 2026, this guy’s a shutdown corner with immediate Day 1 starter upside and the traits to become a CB1 in the NFL. Weaknesses: Size and length limit him against taller vertical threats; recovery burst can lag slightly against true elite burners who get a step.

10,Sonny Styles,Ohio State,5081807,,"Sonny Styles (6’4/243) served as a three-year starter for Ohio State in 2025, transitioning from safety to linebacker and anchoring one of the nation’s top defenses. He recorded 77 tackles, 7 TFLs, 1 sack, 1 interception, 1 forced fumble, and displayed near-elite tackling efficiency (only 1 miss all season). Earned All-Big Ten honors and ranked as a top-10 overall prospect on several big boards (LB2 behind Arvell Reese in some rankings). Showed excellent 4.48 speed, smooth transitional movement, strong coverage skills (low yards per catch allowed), and sideline-to-sideline range in both run and pass phases. Versatile three-down linebacker capable of playing Mike, Will, or dime roles, with leadership traits and immediate starter upside at the next level. Weaknesses include inconsistent physicality and shedding vs. climbing blockers, occasional slow reads or false steps in run fits when aggressive, and ongoing need for added functional strength and mass to anchor against power run games. Projects as a high-floor, early Day 2 selection (late 1st/early 2nd range) in the 2026 NFL Draft with the athletic profile and production to develop into a long-term starter and potential Pro Bowl contributor.",Senior,6'4,243,4.48,0.4

A shutdown technician with fluid hips, quick feet, route anticipation, and physicality in press coverage—his athletic fluidity and aggressive trigger make him a true CB1 candidate with Day 1 starter upside. Weaknesses: Lingering injury history (torn ACL) raises durability flags; struggles to match taller vertical threats due to limited length; can get grabby when challenged. Still, the traits scream high-ceiling starter in the 2026 draft.",Junior,6'0,193,4.52,0.25
12,Makai Lemon,USC,4870795,,"Makai Lemon (5’11/195) emerged as USC’s primary receiving threat in 2025, leading the Trojans with 96 receptions for 1,156 yards (96.3 YPG) and 11 touchdowns while also contributing as a return specialist with multiple scores on punts and kicks. His performance earned the Fred Biletnikoff Award (first Trojan since Marqise Lee in 2012), unanimous All-American honors, and Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year finalist status. Lemon displayed crisp route-running, reliable hands, quick acceleration after the catch, and versatility across alignments (slot, boundary, motion). He consistently generated separation underneath and intermediate, created yards after contact, and impacted games in multiple phases. Areas for development include limited height and contested-catch ability against longer corners, as well as occasional concentration drops in heavy traffic or at the high point. Overall, his production, polish, and playmaking position him as a high-upside receiver with WR1/WR2 potential in pro schemes and Day 1 starter traits in the 2026 NFL Draft.",Junior,5'11,195,4.48,1.4

A towering, violent-handed monster with a devastating bull rush, gap-clogging power, and a nonstop motor — this guy’s a versatile 5-technique/EDGE hybrid built like a brick wall with NFL starter traits already stamped on him. Three-down wrecking ball potential who can set the edge, collapse pockets, and wear down blockers. Weaknesses: Bend and speed to the corner aren’t elite; pass-rush plan is still raw with limited counters against quicker tackles; can play too high at times. Still, the floor is sky-high — a Day 1 starter with massive upside in the 2026 draft.",Junior,6'6,285,4.74,0.5
14,Peter Woods,Clemson,4871063,,"Peter Woods (6’3/315) wasn’t just an anchor—he was the immovable force that powered Clemson’s defensive front in 2025, a true interior wrecking ball with brute power, lightning-quick snap explosion, and relentless disruptive presence that racked up multiple sacks, TFLs, and pressures while stonewalling run lanes. Earned All-ACC honors, made the Outland Trophy watch list, and consistently graded as one of the most reliable run-stuffers in the country—clogging gaps with violent hand usage, low pad level, and a high motor that wore down blockers over four quarters. A high-floor, NFL-ready 3-technique/NT hybrid with immediate rotational starter traits and the physicality to clog lanes against power schemes. Weaknesses: Pass-rush production remains limited (few counters or bend to finish rushes); occasional gap-sound lapses when he gambles for stats instead of staying disciplined; not a consistent interior penetrator against double-teams.

Sadiq displayed strong vertical seam ability, good leaping at the catch point, precise route-running, and versatility across alignments (in-line, slot, motion), forcing defensive coordinators to adjust coverage schemes weekly. He contributed on over 50% of snaps as a blocker, adding legitimate every-down value. Declared early for the 2026 NFL Draft following a breakout junior season. Weaknesses include inconsistent blocking technique (needs added mass and improved hand placement) and a 245-pound frame that can be overpowered by NFL-caliber power edges in the run game until further development. Overall, his receiving polish, athletic traits, and production position him as a high-upside TE with Day 1 starter potential and TE1/TE2 ceiling in pro schemes.",Junior,6'3,245,4.55,1.2

Earned All-SEC First Team honors and SEC Offensive Player of the Year finalist recognition, demonstrating strong arm strength, deep-ball accuracy, pocket poise, mobility to extend plays, and the ability to make reads under pressure. A dual-threat quarterback capable of attacking all levels of the field and leading the offense effectively. Weaknesses include occasional happy feet and hold-the-ball tendencies when facing pressure, aggressive decision-making in tight windows against elite coverage, and pre-snap processing that can lag under duress. Projects as a mid-to-late Day 2 selection (Round 2-4 range) in the 2026 NFL Draft with starter potential in schemes that utilize his arm talent and mobility, provided he refines decision-making and pocket mechanics.",Junior,6'2,208,4.8,1.6
17,Avieon Terrell,Clemson,4870988,,"Avieon Terrell (5’11/180) didn’t just emerge in 2025—he became Clemson’s shutdown lockdown artist at boundary and nickel, rewriting the record books with a monster season: 48 tackles, 4.5 TFLs, 3 sacks, 9 PBUs, and an eye-popping 5 forced fumbles (new Clemson DB single-season record). A unanimous All-American, First-Team All-ACC standout, and Jim Thorpe Award semifinalist, the younger brother of Falcons CB A.J. Terrell flashed elite 4.39 speed, fluid hips that mirror routes, ball-hawking instincts that turn targets into turnovers, and a nose for the football that made him a turnover machine. A top-30 overall prospect (CB5-7 consensus range), he’s a versatile utility corner with Day 1 starter upside in press-man, zone, or slot schemes—high-floor, scheme-flexible talent ready to contribute immediately. Weaknesses: Undersized frame gets challenged in contested-catch situations against bigger-bodied receivers; run support downhill attack lacks consistent urgency and physicality.

18,Cashius Howell,Texas A&M,4710752,,"Cashius Howell (6’2/248) didn’t just play edge for Texas A&M in 2025—he became the most dominant, disruptive force on one of the SEC’s best defensive lines, turning into a game-wrecking nightmare after transferring from Bowling Green. In his lone season with the Aggies, Howell exploded with elite burst off the snap, violent hand usage, inside counters (that spin move was filthy), and relentless motor that racked up double-digit sacks, TFLs, pressures, and run-defense stops—earning unanimous All-American honors, SEC Defensive Player of the Year, and consensus top-15 overall prospect status (often EDGE1 or EDGE2 in the class). A bendy, explosive rusher with the length to stack/shed, quickness to win inside, and the power to bull through tackles, he collapsed pockets, erased running lanes, and flipped games with one-play impact—projected as a top-15 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft (Daniel Jeremiah had him at No. 15 to Tampa Bay in his first mock). Versatile enough to rush from wide-9, 5-technique, or even slide inside on sub-packages, Howell’s traits scream Day 1 starter with All-Pro ceiling. Weaknesses: Occasional high pad level vs. stronger interior blockers; pass-rush plan can be power-heavy without elite bend against quicker tackles; needs added mass for anchor strength in heavy run fronts. But the tape is undeniable—this is a franchise-altering edge rusher ready to dominate NFL offenses from Week 1 in 2026.",Senior,6'4,248,4.65,0.5

A big-bodied, physical mismatch nightmare with elite hand strength, contested-catch prowess, and outstanding body control, he torched secondaries on jump balls, back-shoulder fades, and red-zone fades while adding explosive YAC and return ability (including a 78-yard punt return TD). Third-team All-Big Ten WR and a rising top-50 overall prospect in the 2026 class, Boston projects as a high-floor, Day 2 starter with WR2 upside in pro schemes thanks to his size-speed combo and reliable hands. Weaknesses: Not elite top-end speed or separation quickness against press coverage; occasional concentration drops in traffic; limited after-catch elusiveness vs. elite tacklers.

20,Kayden McDonald,Ohio State,4870893,,"Kayden McDonald (6'3/326) wasn't just a rotational piece in 2025—he became the immovable cornerstone of Ohio State's elite defensive line, evolving into a full-time starting nose tackle who absolutely erased interior gaps with freakish brute power, explosive first-step quickness off the snap, and a relentless high motor that wore down entire offensive lines. He piled up 47 tackles, 8 TFLs, 3 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles, earning All-Big Ten honorable mention and generating top-20 overall prospect buzz (DL2-4 range) as one of the most dominant run-stuffers in the country. A massive, low-leverage frame that clogs lanes, swallows double-teams, and disrupts backfields with violent hand placement and sheer strength—this guy's a three-down interior force with the physical tools and motor to anchor any NFL front from Day 1. Weaknesses: Pass-rush arsenal remains limited (few counters or bend to finish rushes); can get a tick slow off the snap in obvious passing situations when he's not in attack mode. Still, the floor is rock-solid and the ceiling is sky-high—a dominant nose tackle difference-maker with immediate starter impact and All-Pro potential in the 2026 draft.",Junior,6'3,326,5.15,0.35

Parker (6'3/265) cemented his legacy as one of the most technically sound and physically dominant edge-setters in college football during a relentless 2025 season at Clemson, finishing with 39 tackles, 9.5 TFLs, 5 sacks, and a career-defining three-sack demolition of South Carolina that earned him ACC Defensive Lineman of the Week honors and solidified his reputation as a run-game eraser. A technically advanced power-rusher with violent, active hand-fighting, explosive bull rush, and the brute strength to set the edge against double-teams, Parker consistently graded elite in run defense while flashing the power and leverage to collapse pockets when called upon. Though raw sack totals leveled off after his historic 2024 explosion, his Senior Bowl dominance—where he bullied NFL-caliber tackles—and high-floor traits made him a plug-and-play Day 1 impact player with first-round pedigree. Versatile enough to line up as a 5-technique or stand-up rusher, he's a high-motor, scheme-diverse force ready to anchor any NFL front from Week 1. Weaknesses: Pass-rush plan can be one-dimensional at times (relies heavily on power over counters); occasional high pad level vs. quicker tackles; production dipped slightly from 2024 peak.

Coming off a 2024 breakout (4.5 sacks, 7 TFLs), he carried preseason All-SEC hype, Chuck Bednarik and Bronko Nagurski watch list nods, and top-20/30 overall ranking as a scheme-diverse disruptor capable of collapsing pockets, shedding blocks with violent hands, and erasing gaps with his massive frame. Versatile enough to align inside or on the edge, Banks flashed the tools to become a nightmare for offensive lines—quick get-off, power to bull rush, and the lateral quickness to chase down plays in pursuit. Unfortunately, recurring foot/lower-body injuries derailed the season—he missed most of 2025 and underwent surgery after a re-aggravation—turning what could have been a dominant year into a frustrating medical red-flag chapter. Weaknesses: High pad level and leverage losses when doubled or climbed on; pass-rush technique still needs refinement (limited counters and bend); durability concerns now loom large after multiple setbacks, tanking stock on draft boards. If medicals clear and he shows full recovery in pro days/workouts, the ceiling remains massive—a high-ceiling rotational-to-starter disruptor with Round 3-5 projection (or higher) in the 2026 draft, ready to wreak havoc in any NFL front once healthy.",Senior,6'6,330,5.2,0.35

A former five-star recruit who lived up to the hype, Allen flashed elite range, sudden burst off the edge (multiple sacks/TFLs as a blitzer), lockdown coverage skills in man/match against TEs/RBs, and bone-crushing open-field tackling that left ball carriers seeing stars. He earned All-SEC honorable mention, Butkus Award watch list buzz, and top-30 overall prospect ranking (LB5-8 range) thanks to his athleticism, instincts, and ability to impact every phase—run fits, blitz packages, zone drops, and even nickel sub-packages.

A confident press-man technician with ideal length, fluid hips, 4.4 speed, sticky ball-tracking, and physicality in run support, Hood (nephew of ex-NFL CB Roderick Hood) shut down one side of the field and forced quarterbacks to look elsewhere—declaring early for 2026 after one dominant, eye-opening season. An early-round riser (late 1st/early 2nd projection) with legit CB1 upside, he's a high-floor, scheme-flexible boundary/nickel weapon ready to lock down NFL receivers from Week 1. Weaknesses: Raw technique leads to aggression penalties; tackling inconsistencies (lunges and shoulder leads instead of wrapping); zone coverage can open hips early for inside breaks.

He provided consistent interior pressure and run defense, earning first-team All-ACC recognition and solidifying his status as a productive edge rusher with good quickness, hand usage, and power for his size. Versatile alignment options (stand-up EDGE to 5-technique) and high effort allowed him to impact both pass and run phases in a loaded front. Declared for the 2026 NFL Draft. Weaknesses include a power-reliant pass-rush plan with limited counters/bend against quicker tackles, occasional leverage issues when pad level rises, and age (turns 25 in April 2026) which may factor into team evaluations.

Posting 27 tackles (19 solo), 1.5 TFLs, 1 INT, 1 forced fumble, and 5 PBUs, he declared early on Dec. 11 for the 2026 Draft with elite athleticism that screams NFL starter: ideal length, 4.35 blazing speed, fluid hips, lightning-quick feet, dominant press-man technique (microscopic completion % when targeted), explosive change-of-direction, and physicality that punishes receivers at the catch point. A versatile outside/nickel weapon with Day 1 starter upside, Cisse earned top CB4-8 buzz across mocks (late 1st/early 2nd from Mel Kiper, CBS, Tankathon) thanks to his shutdown traits and scheme flexibility. Weaknesses: Raw technique leads to aggression penalties; tackling inconsistencies (lunges and missed wraps in space); low career ball production (few INTs); zone coverage processing lags (opens hips early for inside breaks); injury history (forearm 2024, knee 2025) adds medical caution. Still, the ceiling is sky-high—if he polishes the details and stays healthy, he's a high-ceiling CB1 with lockdown potential ready to dominate NFL secondaries from Week 1 in the 2026 draft.",Junior,6'0,190,4.35,0.25

Versatile alignment options (stand-up EDGE to 5-technique) and a high motor allowed him to impact both pass and run phases, earning rotational snaps in a loaded defensive line group. A developmental prospect with starter traits if he continues to add functional strength and refines technique. Weaknesses: Limited bend and corner speed limit his ability to win consistently with pure speed rush; pass-rush plan can be power-reliant with fewer counters; occasional leverage issues when pad level rises against stronger tackles; run defense physicality needs added mass to anchor reliably against doubles.

Earning All-Big Ten honors and consensus top-50 overall buzz (S top-5 range), Thieneman is a versatile single-high/box chess piece with ball skills, 4.35 pursuit speed, pre-snap recognition, and the kind of scheme fit that makes coordinators drool—capable of erasing deep threats, triggering downhill in the run game, and flipping field position with turnovers. A high-motor, high-IQ defender with Day 2 starter upside and the traits to develop into a Pro Bowl safety in the right system.

This former under-the-radar recruit led the entire FBS in coverage snaps without surrendering a single touchdown (458+ snaps of lockdown duty), flashing elite ball-tracking, lightning-quick feet, sticky man coverage, and a nose for the football that turned targets into turnovers and momentum swings. A rising mid-round prospect (first-to-third round range) with boundary and nickel versatility, he projects as a high-floor Day 1 starter with the traits to develop into a reliable CB2 or slot weapon in the NFL.

A physical boundary receiver with good size, power through contact, burst after the catch, body control, and contested-catch ability, he displayed traits similar to A.J. Brown in run-after-catch situations and red-zone effectiveness, with early first-round buzz before the injury.

A preseason darling as one of the conference's premier pass rushers, Jacas backed it up with violent hand usage, explosive power, sideline-to-sideline range, razor-sharp instincts, and a wrestling background that turned block-shedding into an art form. His ability to set the edge, bull rush tackles, and drop into coverage made him a true three-down menace and vocal leader who elevated the entire Illinois front. Versatile enough to stand up, rush from a 5-technique, or play off-ball in sub-packages, he's a high-motor disruptor with Day 2 upside and the raw tools to develop into a rotational-to-starter NFL edge piece. Weaknesses: Hip stiffness can limit fluidity in coverage transitions; length limitations make it tough to disengage vs. longer tackles; consistency dipped after a massive sophomore leap, with occasional technique lapses under pressure.

His reliable hands make him a valuable third-down asset, though his pass protection technique remains a developmental priority. Currently ranked as the RB2 on major big boards, Coleman is widely projected as a fringe second-to-third-round pick (roughly 30th to 70th overall).

However, following the NCAA's denial on January 9, 2026—and despite an ongoing legal battle for an injunction—he is currently projected as a top-three quarterback for the 2026 NFL Draft.

746,Raion Strader,Pittsburg,5101077,,"Raion Strader (6’0/185) returned to his roots in 2026, committing to Pittsburgh as a high-profile transfer after a ""sticky"" 2025 campaign at Auburn. This local Penn Hills standout excels in press-man coverage, utilizing ""patient hands"" and elite hip fluidity to record over 10 pass deflections against elite SEC vertical threats. While he must continue adding functional mass to consistently stack-and-shed physical NFL ""power"" receivers, his 4.45-speed and ""ball-hawk"" mentality highlight a high-end starter's floor. Following a productive 2025 season where he allowed a career-low passer rating when targeted, Strader is firmly in the Day 2 conversation. He offers the rare combination of length, diagnostic instincts, and recovery burst required to anchor a modern professional secondary.",,6'0,185,,0.25

757,Xavier Scott,Illinois,4917004,,"Xavier Scott (5’10”, 200 lbs) brings explosiveness and versatility as a running back, totaling 900+ all-purpose yards with contributions as a rusher and receiver. He shows excellent lateral agility, burst through creases, and value on third downs. Scott creates mismatches in space but lacks ideal size for sustained interior work and can be inconsistent in pass protection. While not a postseason award winner, his production and versatility stand out. He profiles as a change-of-pace NFL back with receiving upside, best suited for a committee role that maximizes his space and matchup ability.",Senior,5'11,195,,0.25

759,Ahmad Moten Sr.,Miami (FL),4685117,,"Ahmad Moten Sr. (6’3/290 est.) rotated in Miami’s interior snaps in 2025, adding tackles, TFLs, and pocket pressure in run and pass phases. Quickness for size, active hands to disengage, and power to anchor against doubles stood out when pad level stayed low. Developmental 3-technique/nose tackle with multi-alignment value and high motor in short bursts. Leverage issues arise when pad level rises against climbing blockers; pass-rush counters are limited with little bend against quicker guards; stamina drops in extended reps. Day 3 projection (Round 5-7) in the 2026 NFL Draft with upside as rotational depth if technique is refined and strength is added.",Senior,6'3,324,,0.35
