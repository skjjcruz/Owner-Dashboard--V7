The numbers are absurd: 3,535 passing yards, a nation-leading 41 passing touchdowns (plus 6 more on the ground), 70%+ completion rate, and ice-cold poise in the pocket that turned chaos into touchdowns. Maxwell Award finalist, All-Big Ten First Team, consensus QB1 across every 2026 mock draft board—this is a franchise-altering gunslinger with pinpoint accuracy, elite pocket presence, and the leadership to elevate any team. Weaknesses: Average arm strength caps his deep-ball velocity against elite secondaries; occasional sack-prone habits when pressure gets home (though he’s cleaned up significantly). Still, the ceiling is sky-high: a Day 1 starter with Pro Bowl potential and the arm talent/mental makeup to dominate the NFL for a decade. ",Junior,6'5,225,4.85,1.6

A true unicorn with immediate Day 1 starter upside in single-high, two-high, box, or nickel roles, capable of flipping games with one play. Weaknesses: Over-aggressive tendencies (sells out for hits, occasional missed tackles in space); size/durability concerns against bigger tight ends and blockers in the run game; not elite top-end recovery speed vs. true burners. Still, the traits scream franchise safety—first defensive back off the board in 2026 with All-Pro ceiling written all over him.",Junior,6'0,205,4.45,0.35
Arvell Reese,Ohio State,4950400,,"Arvell Reese (6’4/243) didn’t just play linebacker for Ohio State in 2025—he became the heartbeat of one of the nation’s most feared defenses, exploding as a true sideline-to-sideline missile with rare athleticism, explosive pass-rush bursts (multiple sacks and TFLs), lockdown coverage skills that erased tight ends and backs, and instincts that made him look like he had the play script before the snap. Earned All-Big Ten honors, Butkus Award watch list buzz, and top-10 overall prospect ranking in some big boards (LB2 behind only the elite). A versatile three-down weapon who thrives in space, blitzes with violence, and covers like a safety—immediate NFL starter traits with All-Pro ceiling written all over him. Weaknesses: Still building stack-and-shed strength against climbing blockers; occasional over-pursuit and false steps in run fit when he gets too eager. But the upside is undeniable—rising LB1 candidate in the 2026 draft with high-ceiling, impact-starter potential from Day 1.",Junior,6'4,243,4.52,0.4

Legit 4.4 speed that turns on a dime, vision that sees lanes before they exist, velvet-soft hands (50+ catches as a receiver), and home-run burst that left secondaries in the dust—racking up 1,200+ all-purpose yards and 12+ TDs while punishing anyone who dared tackle him. A Doak Walker semifinalist with All-Independent honors, this dude is the ultimate zone-scheme cheat code: patient behind the line, decisive when the hole opens, and absolutely electric in space. He lines up in the slot, smokes linebackers on screens, catches swing passes like a WR, and turns short gains into house calls with YAC violence. Versatile modern weapon who can be your RB1, change-of-pace back, or third-down mismatch nightmare—early 2026 first-round whispers are turning into screams. Weaknesses? Pass-pro technique is still maturing (occasional whiffs against speed rushers); ball security lapses under heavy contact (a few fumbles when he’s taking big hits). But those are coachable, fixable, low-floor issues on a sky-high ceiling. The traits scream RB1 from Day 1: elite burst, vision, hands, contact balance, special-teams upside, and the kind of juice that makes defensive coordinators lose sleep. In a loaded 2026 RB class, Love is the one teams will fight over at the top of Round 1. Franchise back. Game-changer. The clear #1 RB off the board. ",Junior,6'0,214,4.4,1.4

A Nagurski Trophy finalist, unanimous All-American, and consensus top-5 EDGE on every big board, Bain combined a powerful, explosive frame with a lightning-quick first step, elite run-defense anchor, and game-wrecking ability that left tackles helpless. This guy’s a pure NFL disruptor with All-Pro upside, capable of lining up anywhere from 5-technique to stand-up rusher and changing games single-handedly.

He racked up 800+ yards and 8+ touchdowns, flashing explosive deep-threat ability, red-zone dominance, and consistent big-play production that earned him All-Big Ten honors and a spot on the Biletnikoff Award watch list. A true WR1 prospect with first-round polish, smooth releases, and the contested-catch reliability scouts drool over, positioning him as a top-15 overall wideout in the loaded 2026 class.

Jordyn Tyson,Arizona State,4880281,,"Jordyn Tyson (6’2/200) didn’t just transfer from Colorado to Arizona State in 2025—he became an absolute matchup nightmare and one of the most dominant boundary receivers in the country. He torched defenses for 1,000+ yards and 10+ touchdowns, blending elite contested-catch ability (top-10 class rate), explosive YAC burst after the catch, and physical dominance at the catch point that made him nearly impossible to cover on the perimeter. Earned All-Big 12 honors and Biletnikoff Award semifinalist buzz while showcasing reliable hands, nuanced route-running, and red-zone mastery that turned jump balls into touchdowns. A polished, low-risk separator with WR2/WR1 upside in NFL schemes. Weaknesses: Lacks elite top-end speed to consistently stretch the field vertically; can be jammed and slowed at the line by physical, long press-man corners. Still, the combination of size, hands, and production gives him high Day 2 (Round 2-3) projection with immediate starter traits in 2026. ",Junior,6'2,200,4.5,1.4
David Bailey,Texas Tech,4685248,,"David Bailey (6’3/250) exploded in 2025 at Texas Tech (post-Stanford transfer), leading FBS with 13.5 sacks, 17.5 TFLs, a 93 PFF pass-rush grade (highest among EDGEs), Unanimous All-American honors, Big 12 Defensive Lineman of the Year, and a #3 ranking on Bruce Feldman’s Freaks List. Elite first-step burst, closing speed, violent hands, and relentless production make him a top-10 overall prospect (potential No. 2-3 non-QB). Explosive pass-rush specialist with three-down flashes and game-wrecking upside. Weaknesses: Poor run defense anchor (timid vs. blockers, high pad level, engulfed often); emotional control issues (past incidents) may drop stock slightly. High-upside disruptor with Day 1 impact potential in 2026. ",Senior,6'3,250,4.52,0.5
Peter Woods,Clemson,4871063,,"Peter Woods (6’3/315) wasn’t just an anchor—he was the immovable force that powered Clemson’s defensive front in 2025, a true interior wrecking ball with brute power, lightning-quick snap explosion, and relentless disruptive presence that racked up multiple sacks, TFLs, and pressures while stonewalling run lanes. Earned All-ACC honors, made the Outland Trophy watch list, and consistently graded as one of the most reliable run-stuffers in the country—clogging gaps with violent hand usage, low pad level, and a high motor that wore down blockers over four quarters. A high-floor, NFL-ready 3-technique/NT hybrid with immediate rotational starter traits and the physicality to clog lanes against power schemes. Weaknesses: Pass-rush production remains limited (few counters or bend to finish rushes); occasional gap-sound lapses when he gambles for stats instead of staying disciplined; not a consistent interior penetrator against double-teams. Still, the tape screams dependable mid-round value in the 2026 draft—perfect Day 2 rotational piece with three-down upside if he refines the rush plan.",Junior,6'3,315,4.75,0.35

Three-down wrecking ball potential who can set the edge, collapse pockets, and wear down blockers. Weaknesses: Bend and speed to the corner aren’t elite; pass-rush plan is still raw with limited counters against quicker tackles; can play too high at times. Still, the floor is sky-high — a Day 1 starter with massive upside in the 2026 draft. ",Junior,6'6,285,4.74,0.5

A shutdown technician with fluid hips, quick feet, route anticipation, and physicality in press coverage—his athletic fluidity and aggressive trigger make him a true CB1 candidate with Day 1 starter upside. Weaknesses: Lingering injury history (torn ACL) raises durability flags; struggles to match taller vertical threats due to limited length; can get grabby when challenged. Still, the traits scream high-ceiling starter in the 2026 draft. ",Junior,6'0,193,4.52,0.25
Mansoor Delane,LSU,4880124,,"Mansoor Delane (6’0/190) didn’t just lock down LSU’s secondary in 2025—he turned it into a no-fly zone after transferring from Virginia Tech, leading the entire SEC with 13 pass breakups, allowing a microscopic 26.7 passer rating when targeted, racking up 45 tackles, and snagging multiple INTs/PBUs that flipped games. A unanimous All-American, First-Team All-SEC selection, Jim Thorpe Award semifinalist, and consensus top-15 overall prospect (CB3-5 range), Delane is an elite press-man technician with lightning-quick feet, razor-sharp route awareness, ball-hawking instincts, and nasty physicality in run support that makes him a complete boundary nightmare.

A dynamic, explosive separator with razor-sharp route-running, lightning-quick RAC burst, glue-like reliable hands, and the versatility to dominate from the slot, boundary, or motion alignments—earning unanimous All-American honors, Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year finalist status, and consensus first-round buzz as a top-15 WR prospect. This guy’s a matchup nightmare with WR1/2 ceiling in pro schemes, capable of stretching defenses horizontally and vertically while creating after the catch. Weaknesses: Lacks elite height and contested-catch dominance against longer corners; occasional concentration drops in heavy traffic or when contested at the high point. Still, the polish, production, and playmaking scream high-upside superstar ready to dominate the NFL from Day 1 in the 2026 draft.",Junior,5'11,195,4.48,1.4

Earned All-Big Ten honors, ranked as a top-10 overall prospect (No. 9 on some big boards, LB2 behind only Arvell Reese), and flashed elite 4.48 speed, smooth transitional movement, coverage mastery (ridiculously low YPC allowed), and sideline-to-sideline range that made him a matchup nightmare in space. A true three-down ’backer with leadership intangibles, run-and-chase instincts, and the versatility to play Mike, Will, or even dime roles—immediate NFL starter upside with Pro Bowl ceiling. Weaknesses: Inconsistent physicality and shedding ability vs. climbing blockers; occasional slow reads/false steps in run fit when he gets too aggressive; still needs added stack/shed strength and mass to dominate in the trenches.

A true athletic nightmare for defenses: elite vertical seam-stretching ability, hurdle-like leaping at the catch point, razor-sharp route precision, and seamless versatility across alignments (in-line, slot, motion) that forced coordinators to scheme around him every week. His high-motor blocking (50%+ snaps) adds legitimate every-down value, making him far more than a receiving specialist. Declared early for 2026 after a historic breakout junior year. Weaknesses: Blocking technique remains inconsistent (needs added mass and hand placement refinement); 245-pound frame can get overpowered by NFL power edges in run game until he bulks up. Still, the receiving polish, athletic traits, and production scream elite TE1/2 upside in the NFL—a Day 1 starter with Pro Bowl potential in the right system. ",Junior,6'3,245,4.55,1.2

A unanimous All-American, First-Team All-ACC standout, and Jim Thorpe Award semifinalist, the younger brother of Falcons CB A.J. Terrell flashed elite 4.39 speed, fluid hips that mirror routes, ball-hawking instincts that turn targets into turnovers, and a nose for the football that made him a turnover machine. A top-30 overall prospect (CB5-7 consensus range), he’s a versatile utility corner with Day 1 starter upside in press-man, zone, or slot schemes—high-floor, scheme-flexible talent ready to contribute immediately. Weaknesses: Undersized frame gets challenged in contested-catch situations against bigger-bodied receivers; run support downhill attack lacks consistent urgency and physicality. Still, the traits scream first-round potential in the 2026 draft—a shutdown playmaker with CB1 upside if he adds strength and polish. ",Junior,5'11,180,4.39,0.25
Ty Simpson,Alabama,4685522,,"Ty Simpson (6’3/215) didn’t just lead Alabama’s offense in 2025—he became the living embodiment of the Tide’s quarterback legacy, stepping into the spotlight with poise beyond his years and turning every snap into a highlight reel. Explosive arm talent, pinpoint deep-ball accuracy, and elite pocket presence allowed him to sling it for 3,800+ yards, 38 TDs, and a 68%+ completion rate while adding 400+ rushing yards and 6 scores on the ground. Earned All-SEC First Team, SEC Offensive Player of the Year finalist, and top-5 QB buzz nationally as a dual-threat maestro who elevates everyone around him. A true franchise quarterback prospect with the arm strength to hit every window, the mobility to extend plays, and the leadership to command huddles under the brightest lights. Weaknesses: Occasional happy feet and hold-the-ball tendencies when pressure mounts; decision-making can get aggressive in tight windows against elite secondaries; needs refinement in pre-snap reads under duress.

A big-bodied, physical mismatch nightmare with elite hand strength, contested-catch prowess, and outstanding body control, he torched secondaries on jump balls, back-shoulder fades, and red-zone fades while adding explosive YAC and return ability (including a 78-yard punt return TD). Third-team All-Big Ten WR and a rising top-50 overall prospect in the 2026 class, Boston projects as a high-floor, Day 2 starter with WR2 upside in pro schemes thanks to his size-speed combo and reliable hands. Weaknesses: Not elite top-end speed or separation quickness against press coverage; occasional concentration drops in traffic; limited after-catch elusiveness vs. elite tacklers.

He piled up 47 tackles, 8 TFLs, 3 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles, earning All-Big Ten honorable mention and generating top-20 overall prospect buzz (DL2-4 range) as one of the most dominant run-stuffers in the country. A massive, low-leverage frame that clogs lanes, swallows double-teams, and disrupts backfields with violent hand placement and sheer strength—this guy's a three-down interior force with the physical tools and motor to anchor any NFL front from Day 1.

An electric slot nightmare with intermediate route savvy, sudden burst to create separation underneath, and game-breaking YAC acceleration that shredded pursuit angles and turned short passes into chunk plays. Add elite return ability (multiple return TDs on punts/kicks), chain-moving reliability, and the ability to line up anywhere from the slot to motion alignments, and you have a high-floor, scheme-flexible weapon with legitimate first-round pedigree and WR2 upside in modern NFL offenses. While ball security under pressure and physicality against press coverage remain developmental focal points, the production, explosiveness, and playmaking scream immediate Day 1 impact.

Parker (6'3/265) cemented his legacy as one of the most technically sound and physically dominant edge-setters in college football during a relentless 2025 season at Clemson, finishing with 39 tackles, 9.5 TFLs, 5 sacks, and a career-defining three-sack demolition of South Carolina that earned him ACC Defensive Lineman of the Week honors and solidified his reputation as a run-game eraser. A technically advanced power-rusher with violent, active hand-fighting, explosive bull rush, and the brute strength to set the edge against double-teams, Parker consistently graded elite in run defense while flashing the power and leverage to collapse pockets when called upon. Though raw sack totals leveled off after his historic 2024 explosion, his Senior Bowl dominance—where he bullied NFL-caliber tackles—and high-floor traits made him a plug-and-play Day 1 impact player with first-round pedigree. Versatile enough to line up as a 5-technique or stand-up rusher, he's a high-motor, scheme-diverse force ready to anchor any NFL front from Week 1. Weaknesses: Pass-rush plan can be one-dimensional at times (relies heavily on power over counters); occasional high pad level vs. quicker tackles; production dipped slightly from 2024 peak. Still, the tape screams high-floor starter with All-Pro upside in the right system—top-15 pick potential in the 2026 draft.",Junior,6'3,265,4.65,0.5
Caleb Banks,Florida,4602019,,"Caleb Banks (6'6/330) entered 2025 as one of the most physically gifted and intriguing defensive linemen in college football—a towering, explosive 3-tech/5-tech prototype with rare length, freakish burst off the snap, and the agility to flip games in both run and pass phases. Coming off a 2024 breakout (4.5 sacks, 7 TFLs), he carried preseason All-SEC hype, Chuck Bednarik and Bronko Nagurski watch list nods, and top-20/30 overall ranking as a scheme-diverse disruptor capable of collapsing pockets, shedding blocks with violent hands, and erasing gaps with his massive frame. Versatile enough to align inside or on the edge, Banks flashed the tools to become a nightmare for offensive lines—quick get-off, power to bull rush, and the lateral quickness to chase down plays in pursuit. Unfortunately, recurring foot/lower-body injuries derailed the season—he missed most of 2025 and underwent surgery after a re-aggravation—turning what could have been a dominant year into a frustrating medical red-flag chapter. Weaknesses: High pad level and leverage losses when doubled or climbed on; pass-rush technique still needs refinement (limited counters and bend); durability concerns now loom large after multiple setbacks, tanking stock on draft boards. If medicals clear and he shows full recovery in pro days/workouts, the ceiling remains massive—a high-ceiling rotational-to-starter disruptor with Round 3-5 projection (or higher) in the 2026 draft, ready to wreak havoc in any NFL front once healthy.",Senior,6'6,330,5.2,0.35

A confident press-man technician with ideal length, fluid hips, 4.4 speed, sticky ball-tracking, and physicality in run support, Hood (nephew of ex-NFL CB Roderick Hood) shut down one side of the field and forced quarterbacks to look elsewhere—declaring early for 2026 after one dominant, eye-opening season. An early-round riser (late 1st/early 2nd projection) with legit CB1 upside, he's a high-floor, scheme-flexible boundary/nickel weapon ready to lock down NFL receivers from Week 1. Weaknesses: Raw technique leads to aggression penalties; tackling inconsistencies (lunges and shoulder leads instead of wrapping); zone coverage can open hips early for inside breaks. Still, the tape screams high-ceiling starter with the tools to become a shutdown force in the 2026 draft.",Sophomore,6'0,195,4.43,0.25
Brandon Cisse,South Carolina,5076652,,"Brandon Cisse (6'0/190) didn't just emerge in 2025—he exploded onto the national scene as a first-round caliber corner at South Carolina after transferring from NC State, starting all 12 games and delivering lockdown coverage that forced quarterbacks to avoid his side entirely. Posting 27 tackles (19 solo), 1.5 TFLs, 1 INT, 1 forced fumble, and 5 PBUs, he declared early on Dec. 11 for the 2026 Draft with elite athleticism that screams NFL starter: ideal length, 4.35 blazing speed, fluid hips, lightning-quick feet, dominant press-man technique (microscopic completion % when targeted), explosive change-of-direction, and physicality that punishes receivers at the catch point. A versatile outside/nickel weapon with Day 1 starter upside, Cisse earned top CB4-8 buzz across mocks (late 1st/early 2nd from Mel Kiper, CBS, Tankathon) thanks to his shutdown traits and scheme flexibility. Weaknesses: Raw technique leads to aggression penalties; tackling inconsistencies (lunges and missed wraps in space); low career ball production (few INTs); zone coverage processing lags (opens hips early for inside breaks); injury history (forearm 2024, knee 2025) adds medical caution.

A big-bodied bully with AJ Brown-like traits: uncommon power through contact, explosive burst after the catch, elite body control, and contested-catch dominance that turned jump balls into touchdowns and red-zone nightmares. Preseason All-ACC darling with legitimate first-round buzz early in the year, he was carving up secondaries with RAC violence and physical boundary presence. Then came the torn ACL vs. SMU in November—season-ending injury, immediate surgery, and a major question mark on his 2026 draft stock. Weaknesses: Inconsistent early-career production before the breakout; route nuance still raw and needs polish; occasional ball-security lapses under duress; the ACL tear now carries significant medical/red-flag risk that could drop him from first-round lock to mid-round value (Round 3-5 range) depending on recovery and medicals. If he comes back strong and shows no lingering issues, the upside remains massive—high-ceiling WR2/3 with WR1 flashes in the right scheme.

Keith Abney II,Arizona State,5093004,,"Keith Abney II (6'0/190) didn't just improve in 2025—he straight-up transformed from a three-star afterthought into one of the most dominant shutdown corners in college football at Arizona State, posting 44 tackles, 12 pass breakups, 2 forced fumbles, 2 INTs (including a clutch game-sealing pick vs. West Virginia), and earning First-Team All-Big 12 honors plus first-team All-American recognition from multiple outlets. This former under-the-radar recruit led the entire FBS in coverage snaps without surrendering a single touchdown (458+ snaps of lockdown duty), flashing elite ball-tracking, lightning-quick feet, sticky man coverage, and a nose for the football that turned targets into turnovers and momentum swings. A rising mid-round prospect (first-to-third round range) with boundary and nickel versatility, he projects as a high-floor Day 1 starter with the traits to develop into a reliable CB2 or slot weapon in the NFL. Weaknesses: Lacks elite top-end speed and burst to recover against burners; struggles in contested situations vs. taller vertical threats; run support physicality and downhill urgency still need refinement. But the tape screams high-floor, scheme-flexible corner with Pro Bowl upside if he adds strength and polish—ready to contribute from Week 1 in the 2026 draft.",Junior,6'0,190,4.46,0.25

Romello Height,Texas Tech,,https://texastech.com/images/2025/3/27/Height_Romello.png,"Romello Height (6'3/250 est.) didn't just break out in 2025—he became the explosive heartbeat of Texas Tech's pass rush after a wild transfer journey (Auburn, USC, Georgia Tech → Red Raiders), nearly doubling his career pressures with 9 sacks, 10.5 TFLs, and a deep toolbox of moves that left tackles spinning (that signature spin move was filthy). Helping Texas Tech to a Big 12 title and CFP run, Height flashed elite get-off, technically advanced counters, violent hand usage, and a high-octane motor that made him a constant threat despite his compact frame. A high-motor, athletic disruptor who wins with quickness, bend flashes, and relentless pursuit—mid-round projection with legitimate rotational-to-starter upside and the traits to climb boards if he adds functional strength. Weaknesses: Undersized frame gets engulfed or pushed around in the power run game; bend and corner speed remain average against longer, quicker tackles; consistency dips when facing stronger, more physical blockers. Still, the tape screams Round 3-4 steal in the 2026 draft—a high-motor, technically savvy edge piece ready to wreak havoc as a rotational game-changer with starter potential in the right scheme.",Junior,6'3,240,4.7,0.5
L.T. Overton,Alabama,4870960,,"L.T. Overton (6'5/278) didn't just anchor Alabama's defensive line in 2025—he became the ultimate Swiss Army knife, a versatile EDGE/DL monster who could line up anywhere from 5-technique to stand-up rusher and wreak havoc across alignments. Posting career totals of 132 tackles, 7 sacks, and elite run-defense grades that consistently shut down interior gaps, he earned All-SEC buzz, top-50 overall prospect ranking (EDGE9 range), and the reputation as one of the most scheme-diverse linemen in the country. A rare size-speed combo with violent power push, active hand usage, and the motor to play heavy snaps without fading—high-floor traits that scream immediate NFL starter upside in any front. Whether setting the edge against the run, collapsing pockets with bull rushes, or dropping into coverage flashes, Overton's multi-alignment value and physical tools make him a plug-and-play difference-maker. Weaknesses: Average hand accuracy and pass-rush counters limit his ability to finish rushes consistently; high pad level can be exploited by quicker tackles; get-off in obvious pass situations remains inconsistent and needs refinement. Still, the tape screams Day 2 steal in the 2026 draft—a rotational-to-starter disruptor with the frame, power, and versatility to grow into a three-down force and eventual anchor for any NFL defensive line.",Senior,6'5,278,4.85,0.5
Kamari Ramsey,USC,4685518,,"Kamari Ramsey (6'0/204) didn't just solidify his status as one of the nation's top safeties in 2025—he became USC's defensive quarterback and the ultimate chess piece in the secondary, returning for his redshirt junior year to deliver an elite, multi-faceted campaign that earned All-Big Ten honors and consensus top-50 overall prospect buzz. Posting lockdown coverage (absurdly low YPC allowed), multiple INTs/PBUs, and a quick-trigger downhill mentality, Ramsey showcased rare versatility—seamless in single-high, box, nickel, or man-match roles against TEs/slots—with instinctive processing, pursuit speed that closes like a missile, and leadership that set the tone for USC's back seven. A high-IQ processor who reads offenses pre-snap, anticipates routes, and flips momentum with ball disruption, his Senior Bowl invite and film scream Day 2 starter upside with the traits to develop into a Pro Bowl safety in the right scheme. Weaknesses: Tackling technique inconsistencies (lunges and missed tackles in transition); limited elite recovery speed/burst against true burners who get a step; occasional over-aggressiveness leads to penalties or blown assignments when he sells out too hard.

Dillon Thieneman,Oregon,4954445,,"Dillon Thieneman (6'0/205) didn't just star in 2025 at Oregon—he became the defensive heartbeat of the Ducks after transferring from Purdue, building on his historic freshman campaign (74 solo tackles, 6 INTs, FWAA Freshman of the Year) into a full-blown star safety with elite range that covered half the field, punishing tackling technique that left ball carriers seeing stars, razor-sharp instincts, and leadership that elevated the entire secondary. Earning All-Big Ten honors and consensus top-50 overall buzz (S top-5 range), Thieneman is a versatile single-high/box chess piece with ball skills, 4.35 pursuit speed, pre-snap recognition, and the kind of scheme fit that makes coordinators drool—capable of erasing deep threats, triggering downhill in the run game, and flipping field position with turnovers. A high-motor, high-IQ defender with Day 2 starter upside and the traits to develop into a Pro Bowl safety in the right system. Weaknesses: Occasional tackling consistency lapses in space (lunges instead of wrapping); coverage can be tested by elite vertical threats who stretch him deep; physicality and shedding need refinement against bigger blockers.

A Biletnikoff Award semifinalist, All-SEC selection, and one of the most reliable performers in the SEC, Bernard is a route-savvy technician with crisp releases, elite short-to-intermediate separation, YAC elusiveness that turns slants and screens into chunk gains, and the kind of dependable hands and body control that make him a quarterback's best friend in traffic. Versatile enough to line up in the slot, motion across formations, or even take jet sweeps, he's a high-floor, low-risk weapon with WR3/WR4 upside in pro schemes who can move chains on third down and create after the catch. Weaknesses: Lacks elite top-end speed and explosiveness to consistently stretch the field vertically; can be inconsistent against physical press coverage that jams him at the line; modest deep-threat profile limits big-play ceiling against off-coverage looks.

Earning second-team AP All-American honors, two-time All-Big Ten recognition, and defensive MVP of both the Rose and Peach Bowls, Ponds posted a career 169 tackles, 10.5 TFLs, 7 INTs (including a pick-six on the very first play vs. Oregon), and 33 PBUs that terrorized quarterbacks. A track-background speedster with elite quick feet, razor-sharp zone awareness, closing burst, and a nose for the football that forced turnovers and momentum swings, he was Mel Kiper's CB5 and declared early on Jan. 23, 2026. Undersized frame be damned—his competitive fire, ball skills, and nickel/slot versatility scream mid-round riser (Round 3-4 projection) with legitimate Day 1 starter upside as a slot weapon or boundary backup. Weaknesses: Shorter arms and 170-pound frame limit him against taller, physical X receivers in contested situations; run-support physicality needs added strength to consistently shed blocks; occasional gambler tendencies in coverage can lead to big plays when he bites on double moves.

A true transfer success story, Haulcy brought downhill trigger, pre-snap recognition, and the kind of aggressive, physical presence that cleaned up messes in the run game and turned short zones into no-man's land. His football IQ, closing speed, and ability to diagnose plays before they develop made him a reliable chess piece in Brian Kelly's scheme—consistently in the right spot, making the right play, and setting the tone for LSU's back seven. Weaknesses: Coverage range can be limited against true deep threats who stretch the field vertically; run-support physicality still needs polish to consistently shed blocks and finish tackles in space; occasional over-aggressiveness leads to missed assignments or penalties when he sells out too hard. Still, the tape screams late-round/UDFA steal in the 2026 draft—a high-floor depth piece with special teams value and the upside to carve out a rotational box safety role if he adds strength, refines his angles, and proves his range in workouts.

All-SEC honorable mention, top-50 overall prospect buzz (EDGE10 range), and a massive, long-armed frame that creates violent pocket collapse, devastating hand usage, and the kind of power that swallows double-teams and erases running lanes. A high-motor, versatile 5-technique/EDGE hybrid who can stand up, rush from a wide-9, or anchor inside—starter upside with the raw traits to develop into a three-down force at the next level. Weaknesses: Average first-step get-off and burst limit his ability to win with pure speed; aggression sometimes leads to penalties (taunting flags) and discipline issues; off-field concerns (past misdemeanor/DWI) could slide his stock on draft boards to Round 2-3 territory despite the tape.

A preseason darling as one of the conference's premier pass rushers, Jacas backed it up with violent hand usage, explosive power, sideline-to-sideline range, razor-sharp instincts, and a wrestling background that turned block-shedding into an art form. His ability to set the edge, bull rush tackles, and drop into coverage made him a true three-down menace and vocal leader who elevated the entire Illinois front. Versatile enough to stand up, rush from a 5-technique, or play off-ball in sub-packages, he's a high-motor disruptor with Day 2 upside and the raw tools to develop into a rotational-to-starter NFL edge piece. Weaknesses: Hip stiffness can limit fluidity in coverage transitions; length limitations make it tough to disengage vs. longer tackles; consistency dipped after a massive sophomore leap, with occasional technique lapses under pressure.

Posting massive tackle totals (building on 67+ prior with even more elevated production), he racked up stops in every phase while earning Butkus Award nomination, All-SEC honors, and consensus top-50 overall buzz (LB top-5 range). A true Mike linebacker prototype with sideline-to-sideline range, tackling radius that swallows space, and leadership that elevated the entire front seven—immediate NFL starter upside with Pro Bowl potential written all over him.

Earning All-American honors as a true all-purpose threat, Price declared early on Dec. 17, 2025, for the 2026 Draft with low-mileage legs (freshman Achilles tear behind him) and the traits scouts dream about: elite vision to find cutback lanes, sudden burst through holes, patient patience to let blocks develop, YAC elusiveness that turns short gains into chunk plays, and special-teams value that flips field position. Mel Kiper's RB2 and top-80 big boards reflect his Day 2/Round 2-3 projection as a high-upside RB2 in a loaded 2026 class—versatile enough to spell starters, thrive in committees, or even return kicks at the next level. Weaknesses: Limited career volume (complementary role behind Love); ball security concerns (3 fumbles in 2025); pass-pro technique still developing against blitzers; not a true power back who can consistently plow through loaded boxes.

Posting 62 receptions for 769 yards and 4 touchdowns (building on prior production), he earned All-SEC honors, first-team nods, and consensus top-TE buzz as the class's most polished receiving threat. A former high school QB turned ultimate mismatch nightmare, Stowers brings razor-sharp route nuance, elite seam-stretching ability, contested-catch dominance, and freaky athleticism (Bruce Feldman Freaks List) that lets him win in every phase—slot motion, inline seams, red-zone fades, even screens with WR-like YAC burst. Versatile move TE who can align anywhere and force defensive coordinators to scheme specifically for him, with high-motor blocking flashes that add every-down value. Weaknesses: Blocking technique remains inconsistent (lacks anchor mass and hand placement refinement vs. power edges); inline blocking can be overpowered until he adds functional strength; not elite vertical speed limits him against deep safety help. Still, the receiving polish, size-speed combo, and production scream high-ceiling TE1 upside in the 2026 draft—early Day 2 projection as a plug-and-play mismatch weapon ready to stretch seams and win in the NFL from Week 1.",Senior,6'4,235,4.55,1.2

Posting career totals of 123 tackles and 9.5 sacks, Corleone dominated with elite run-stuffing power, violent low pad level, surprising quickness off the snap for his massive frame, and gap-merchant disruption that swallowed double-teams and erased running lanes. Preseason All-American buzz followed him into the year as a high-floor NT with legitimate multi-alignment value—capable of clogging the A-gap, shifting to 3-tech, or even flashing bull-rush pocket push. A true space-eater with the strength to anchor against power schemes and the motor to play heavy snaps without fading, he declared for the 2026 draft as one of the most dependable interior anchors in the class. Weaknesses: Pass-rush consistency and stamina remain limited (few counters beyond power, tires late in long drives); leverage losses when pad level rises against quicker interior linemen; developmental as a pure 3-tech penetrator until he refines hand usage and bend.

Posting 8 sacks, 12 TFLs, and elite run-defense grades, Sapp earned All-SEC honorable mention and surged into mid-round prospect status (EDGE15-20 consensus range) as one of the most productive and athletic big men on the edge in the SEC. Long levers that create leverage nightmares for tackles, sudden first-step burst, and a nonstop motor that wears down blockers over four quarters—he's a versatile force capable of anchoring the edge, rushing from wide alignments, or even sliding inside on sub-packages. High-motor traits and physical tools scream rotational-to-starter upside with the potential to climb boards if he refines his rush plan. Weaknesses: Average bend and corner speed limit his ability to win with pure speed against quicker tackles; pass-rush counters remain raw and one-dimensional; occasional high pad level can be exploited by savvy linemen.

In his lone Miami season, he delivered a career-best 3,813 passing yards, 30 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and a scorching 72.4% completion rate, while adding 43 rushing yards and 2 scores on the ground—earning third-team All-ACC honors as a poised, accurate gunslinger with elite pocket presence, lightning-quick release, surgical timing-route accuracy, big-arm talent to hit every window, and pre-snap mastery that made defenses look predictable. Declared for the 2026 Draft, Beck is a high-floor, high-IQ pocket passer with legitimate starter traits and the arm strength/decision-making to thrive in pro-style offenses. Weaknesses: Inconsistent under pressure (gunslinger tendencies lead to turnovers and risky throws); average deep-ball velocity limits him against elite secondaries; processing can lag vs. complex blitz packages; injury history (UCL/Elbow 2024) adds medical caution.
