Fernando Mendoza,Indiana,4837248,,"Fernando Mendoza (6'5/225) etched his legacy as the 2025 Heisman Trophy winner—the first in Indiana history—while leading the Hoosiers to a flawless 16-0 national championship season, capped by a thrilling 27-21 CFP title win over Miami. Explosive stats: 3,535 yards, nation-leading 41 passing TDs (plus 6 rushing), 70%+ completion rate, and elite poise/decision-making under pressure. Maxwell Award finalist, All-Big Ten honors, and consensus QB1/No. 1 overall mock in 2026—franchise-altering gunslinger with pinpoint accuracy and leadership. Weaknesses: Average arm strength limits elite deep-ball velocity; improved but occasional sack-prone tendencies. High-ceiling starter ready to dominate the NFL.",Junior,6'5,225,4.85
Caleb Downs,Ohio State,4870706,,"Caleb Downs (6'0/205) proved generational after transferring to Ohio State in 2025, blending elite range, football IQ, bone-crushing tackling, ball-hawking (multiple INTs/PBUs), and versatility—earning Thorpe Award finalist, All-American honors, and consensus top-5 overall buzz as a scheme-proof defender. Unicorn traits with immediate starter potential. Weaknesses: Can be overly aggressive (sells out for hits); size/durability questions vs. bigger frames. First DB off the board in 2026.",Junior,6'0,205,4.45
Arvell Reese,Ohio State,4950400,,"Arvell Reese (6'4/243) emerged as a sideline-to-sideline linebacker force in Ohio State's loaded defense during 2025, flashing elite range, explosive pass-rush bursts (multiple sacks/TFLs), lockdown coverage skills, and high instincts—earning All-Big Ten nods and Butkus watch list buzz. Versatile three-down fit with athleticism and physicality. Weaknesses: Still developing block-shedding strength; occasional over-pursuit in space. Rising top LB prospect in 2026 with high-ceiling starter traits.",Junior,6'4,243,4.52
Jeremiyah Love,Notre Dame,4870808,,"Jeremiyah Love (6'0/214) exploded as Notre Dame's three-down RB dynamo in 2025, blending 4.4 speed, elite vision, receiving chops (50+ catches), and home-run ability (1,200+ all-purpose yards, 12+ TDs)—earning Doak Walker semifinalist and All-Independent honors. Dynamic playmaker thriving in zone schemes with top RB buzz in 2026. Weakness: Pass protection technique developing; occasional fumbles under contact. Versatile modern back ready for NFL.",Junior,6'0,214,4.4
Rueben Bain,Miami (FL),4870617,,"Rueben Bain Jr. (6'3/275) exploded as one of college football's most dominant EDGE rushers in 2025, blending freakish athleticism, violent hands, and relentless motor to rack up double-digit sacks, 20+ TFLs, and pressures—earning ACC Defensive Player of the Year, Nagurski finalist, All-American honors, and top-5 EDGE buzz. A powerful frame with quick first step and run-defense strength—pure NFL disruptor with game-wrecking ability and All-Pro upside. Weaknesses: Lacks prototypical arm length and elite bend; occasional undisciplined gaps. Top-10 pick potential in 2026 as a versatile terror.",Junior,6'3,275,4.72
Carnell Tate,Ohio State,4871023,,"Carnell Tate (6'3/195) solidified elite status as Ohio State's next WR factory product in 2025—a smooth, five-star route-runner with elite body control, strong hands, and explosive deep-threat ability (800+ yards, 8+ TDs)—earning All-Big Ten honors and Biletnikoff watch list buzz. Red-zone dominance and consistent big-play hauls position him as a top-15 WR prospect for 2026 with first-round polish and WR1 potential. Weaknesses: Lacks elite speed/explosiveness and YAC playmaking; can be jammed off the line. High-upside separator.",Junior,6'3,195,4.6
Jordyn Tyson,Arizona State,4880281,,"Jordyn Tyson (6'2/200) became a matchup nightmare at Arizona State post-Colorado transfer in 2025, dominating with 1,000+ yards, 10+ TDs, contested-catch prowess (top-10 class rate), explosive YAC, and physical boundary dominance—earning All-Big 12 nods and Biletnikoff semifinalist buzz. Reliable hands, route nuance, and red-zone mastery make him a rising star with WR2/WR1 upside in pro schemes. Weaknesses: Not elite speed; can struggle vs. elite press-man corners. High Day 2 projection with polished, low-risk traits.",Junior,6'2,200,4.5
David Bailey,Texas Tech,4685248,,,Senior,6'3,250,4.52
Peter Woods,Clemson,4871063,,"Peter Woods (6'3/315) anchored Clemson's interior in 2025 as a stout run-stuffer with brute power, quick snap explosion, and disruptive pressures (multiple sacks/TFLs)—earning All-ACC nods and Outland Trophy watch list buzz. Clogs lanes effectively with high-floor traits as a reliable starter. Weaknesses: Limited pass-rush production/plan; occasional gap-sound lapses (gambles for stats). Mid-round value in 2026 with rotational upside.",Junior,6'3,315,4.75
