The numbers are absurd: 3,535 passing yards, a nation-leading 41 passing touchdowns (plus 6 more on the ground), 70%+ completion rate, and ice-cold poise in the pocket that turned chaos into touchdowns. Maxwell Award finalist, All-Big Ten First Team, consensus QB1 across every 2026 mock draft board—this is a franchise-altering gunslinger with pinpoint accuracy, elite pocket presence, and the leadership to elevate any team. Weaknesses: Average arm strength caps his deep-ball velocity against elite secondaries; occasional sack-prone habits when pressure gets home (though he’s cleaned up significantly). Still, the ceiling is sky-high: a Day 1 starter with Pro Bowl potential and the arm talent/mental makeup to dominate the NFL for a decade."

Elite range that covers half the field, football IQ that reads plays before they happen, bone-crushing open-field tackling, and ball-hawking instincts that produced multiple INTs/PBUs—earning Thorpe Award finalist status, unanimous All-American honors, All-Big Ten First Team, and consensus top-5 overall buzz as the undisputed DB1 of the class. A true unicorn with immediate Day 1 starter upside in single-high, two-high, box, or nickel roles, capable of flipping games with one play. Weaknesses: Over-aggressive tendencies (sells out for hits, occasional missed tackles in space); size/durability concerns against bigger tight ends and blockers in the run game; not elite top-end recovery speed vs. true burners. Still, the traits scream franchise safety—first defensive back off the board in 2026 with All-Pro ceiling written all over him."

Earned All-Big Ten honors, Butkus Award watch list buzz, and top-10 overall prospect ranking in some big boards (LB2 behind only the elite). A versatile three-down weapon who thrives in space, blitzes with violence, and covers like a safety—immediate NFL starter traits with All-Pro ceiling written all over him. Weaknesses: Still building stack-and-shed strength against climbing blockers; occasional over-pursuit and false steps in run fit when he gets too eager. But the upside is undeniable—rising LB1 candidate in the 2026 draft with high-ceiling, impact-starter potential from Day 1."

A Doak Walker semifinalist with All-Independent honors, this guy’s a zone-scheme cheat code—patient, decisive, and explosive in every phase, earning top RB buzz and early 2026 first-round whispers. Versatile modern weapon who can line up in the slot, catch screens, and punish secondaries after contact. Weaknesses: Pass-pro technique still maturing (occasional whiffs); ball security lapses under heavy contact (a few fumbles). But the upside is massive—immediate Day 1 starter potential with RB1 traits in the right scheme."

A Nagurski Trophy finalist, unanimous All-American, and consensus top-5 EDGE on every big board, Bain combined a powerful, explosive frame with a lightning-quick first step, elite run-defense anchor, and game-wrecking ability that left tackles helpless. This guy’s a pure NFL disruptor with All-Pro upside, capable of lining up anywhere from 5-technique to stand-up rusher and changing games single-handedly. Weaknesses: Lacks prototypical arm length and elite ankle flexibility/bend to consistently corner; occasional gap discipline lapses when he gets too eager chasing stats. Still, the traits scream top-10 pick in the 2026 draft—a versatile, high-motor monster ready to terrorize NFL offenses from Week 1."
6,6,Carnell Tate,WR,Ohio State,Junior,6'3,195,4.6,1,7.5,10,6.2,true,1.4,8.68,3,4871023,,"Carnell Tate (6’3/195) didn’t just meet expectations in 2025—he became the latest crown jewel in Ohio State’s legendary WR factory, emerging as a polished, five-star separator with elite route-running savvy, vice-like hands, and jaw-dropping body control that made him a nightmare matchup on every level. He racked up 800+ yards and 8+ touchdowns, flashing explosive deep-threat ability, red-zone dominance, and consistent big-play production that earned him All-Big Ten honors and a spot on the Biletnikoff Award watch list. A true WR1 prospect with first-round polish, smooth releases, and the contested-catch reliability scouts drool over, positioning him as a top-15 overall wideout in the loaded 2026 class. Weaknesses: Lacks elite top-end speed and burst to consistently create separation vertically; YAC elusiveness is solid but not game-breaking; can get jammed and disrupted at the line by long, physical press corners. Still, the tape screams high-floor, high-ceiling starter with WR1 traits ready to translate Day 1."

He torched defenses for 1,000+ yards and 10+ touchdowns, blending elite contested-catch ability (top-10 class rate), explosive YAC burst after the catch, and physical dominance at the catch point that made him nearly impossible to cover on the perimeter. Earned All-Big 12 honors and Biletnikoff Award semifinalist buzz while showcasing reliable hands, nuanced route-running, and red-zone mastery that turned jump balls into touchdowns. A polished, low-risk separator with WR2/WR1 upside in NFL schemes. Weaknesses: Lacks elite top-end speed to consistently stretch the field vertically; can be jammed and slowed at the line by physical, long press-man corners. Still, the combination of size, hands, and production gives him high Day 2 (Round 2-3) projection with immediate starter traits in 2026."
8,8,David Bailey,EDGE,Texas Tech,Senior,6'3,250,4.52,1,9.4,10,5.8,true,0.5,2.9,23,4685248,,"David Bailey (6’3/250) exploded in 2025 at Texas Tech (post-Stanford transfer), leading FBS with 13.5 sacks, 17.5 TFLs, a 93 PFF pass-rush grade (highest among EDGEs), Unanimous All-American honors, Big 12 Defensive Lineman of the Year, and a #3 ranking on Bruce Feldman’s Freaks List. Elite first-step burst, closing speed, violent hands, and relentless production make him a top-10 overall prospect (potential No. 2-3 non-QB). Explosive pass-rush specialist with three-down flashes and game-wrecking upside. Weaknesses: Poor run defense anchor (timid vs. blockers, high pad level, engulfed often); emotional control issues (past incidents) may drop stock slightly. High-upside disruptor with Day 1 impact potential in 2026."

Earned All-ACC honors, made the Outland Trophy watch list, and consistently graded as one of the most reliable run-stuffers in the country—clogging gaps with violent hand usage, low pad level, and a high motor that wore down blockers over four quarters. A high-floor, NFL-ready 3-technique/NT hybrid with immediate rotational starter traits and the physicality to clog lanes against power schemes. Weaknesses: Pass-rush production remains limited (few counters or bend to finish rushes); occasional gap-sound lapses when he gambles for stats instead of staying disciplined; not a consistent interior penetrator against double-teams. Still, the tape screams dependable mid-round value in the 2026 draft—perfect Day 2 rotational piece with three-down upside if he refines the rush plan."

A towering, violent-handed monster with a devastating bull rush, gap-clogging power, and a nonstop motor — this guy’s a versatile 5-technique/EDGE hybrid built like a brick wall with NFL starter traits already stamped on him. Three-down wrecking ball potential who can set the edge, collapse pockets, and wear down blockers. Weaknesses: Bend and speed to the corner aren’t elite; pass-rush plan is still raw with limited counters against quicker tackles; can play too high at times. Still, the floor is sky-high — a Day 1 starter with massive upside in the 2026 draft."

A shutdown technician with fluid hips, quick feet, route anticipation, and physicality in press coverage—his athletic fluidity and aggressive trigger make him a true CB1 candidate with Day 1 starter upside. Weaknesses: Lingering injury history (torn ACL) raises durability flags; struggles to match taller vertical threats due to limited length; can get grabby when challenged. Still, the traits scream high-ceiling starter in the 2026 draft."

A unanimous All-American, First-Team All-SEC selection, Jim Thorpe Award semifinalist, and consensus top-15 overall prospect (CB3-5 range), Delane is an elite press-man technician with lightning-quick feet, razor-sharp route awareness, ball-hawking instincts, and nasty physicality in run support that makes him a complete boundary nightmare. Declared early for 2026, this guy’s a shutdown corner with immediate Day 1 starter upside and the traits to become a CB1 in the NFL. Weaknesses: Size and length limit him against taller vertical threats; recovery burst can lag slightly against true elite burners who get a step. Still, the floor is sky-high—high-floor, high-ceiling CB1 potential with lockdown traits ready to translate from Week 1."

A dynamic, explosive separator with razor-sharp route-running, lightning-quick RAC burst, glue-like reliable hands, and the versatility to dominate from the slot, boundary, or motion alignments—earning unanimous All-American honors, Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year finalist status, and consensus first-round buzz as a top-15 WR prospect. This guy’s a matchup nightmare with WR1/2 ceiling in pro schemes, capable of stretching defenses horizontally and vertically while creating after the catch. Weaknesses: Lacks elite height and contested-catch dominance against longer corners; occasional concentration drops in heavy traffic or when contested at the high point. Still, the polish, production, and playmaking scream high-upside superstar ready to dominate the NFL from Day 1 in the 2026 draft."

Earned All-Big Ten honors, ranked as a top-10 overall prospect (No. 9 on some big boards, LB2 behind only Arvell Reese), and flashed elite 4.48 speed, smooth transitional movement, coverage mastery (ridiculously low YPC allowed), and sideline-to-sideline range that made him a matchup nightmare in space. A true three-down ’backer with leadership intangibles, run-and-chase instincts, and the versatility to play Mike, Will, or even dime roles—immediate NFL starter upside with Pro Bowl ceiling. Weaknesses: Inconsistent physicality and shedding ability vs. climbing blockers; occasional slow reads/false steps in run fit when he gets too aggressive; still needs added stack/shed strength and mass to dominate in the trenches. But the traits scream high-ceiling impact player in the 2026 draft—ready to be a difference-maker from Day 1."

A true athletic nightmare for defenses: elite vertical seam-stretching ability, hurdle-like leaping at the catch point, razor-sharp route precision, and seamless versatility across alignments (in-line, slot, motion) that forced coordinators to scheme around him every week. His high-motor blocking (50%+ snaps) adds legitimate every-down value, making him far more than a receiving specialist. Declared early for 2026 after a historic breakout junior year. Weaknesses: Blocking technique remains inconsistent (needs added mass and hand placement refinement); 245-pound frame can get overpowered by NFL power edges in run game until he bulks up. Still, the receiving polish, athletic traits, and production scream elite TE1/2 upside in the NFL—a Day 1 starter with Pro Bowl potential in the right system."

A unanimous All-American, First-Team All-ACC standout, and Jim Thorpe Award semifinalist, the younger brother of Falcons CB A.J. Terrell flashed elite 4.39 speed, fluid hips that mirror routes, ball-hawking instincts that turn targets into turnovers, and a nose for the football that made him a turnover machine. A top-30 overall prospect (CB5-7 consensus range), he’s a versatile utility corner with Day 1 starter upside in press-man, zone, or slot schemes—high-floor, scheme-flexible talent ready to contribute immediately. Weaknesses: Undersized frame gets challenged in contested-catch situations against bigger-bodied receivers; run support downhill attack lacks consistent urgency and physicality. Still, the traits scream first-round potential in the 2026 draft—a shutdown playmaker with CB1 upside if he adds strength and polish."

Explosive arm talent, pinpoint deep-ball accuracy, and elite pocket presence allowed him to sling it for 3,800+ yards, 38 TDs, and a 68%+ completion rate while adding 400+ rushing yards and 6 scores on the ground. Earned All-SEC First Team, SEC Offensive Player of the Year finalist, and top-5 QB buzz nationally as a dual-threat maestro who elevates everyone around him. A true franchise quarterback prospect with the arm strength to hit every window, the mobility to extend plays, and the leadership to command huddles under the brightest lights. Weaknesses: Occasional happy feet and hold-the-ball tendencies when pressure mounts; decision-making can get aggressive in tight windows against elite secondaries; needs refinement in pre-snap reads under duress. Still, the ceiling is stratospheric—top-10 overall pick potential in 2026 with the tools to be a Pro Bowl starter from Day 1 and the swagger to carry a contender."

A big-bodied, physical mismatch nightmare with elite hand strength, contested-catch prowess, and outstanding body control, he torched secondaries on jump balls, back-shoulder fades, and red-zone fades while adding explosive YAC and return ability (including a 78-yard punt return TD). Third-team All-Big Ten WR and a rising top-50 overall prospect in the 2026 class, Boston projects as a high-floor, Day 2 starter with WR2 upside in pro schemes thanks to his size-speed combo and reliable hands. Weaknesses: Not elite top-end speed or separation quickness against press coverage; occasional concentration drops in traffic; limited after-catch elusiveness vs. elite tacklers. Still, the physical tools, production, and upside scream first-round value with WR1 traits if he refines the release package and adds polish."
